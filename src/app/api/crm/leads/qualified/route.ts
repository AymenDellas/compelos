 * The send list. This is the one place where the strict gate is applied, and it
 * stays strict on purpose: an address requires a safe provider verdict or direct
 * SMTP proof, and that verification must be fresh. Everything upstream is allowed
 * to be permissive — leads keep their place in the CRM regardless of email
 * status — because nothing upstream actually sends mail.
 *
 * `?include=risky` widens it to addresses that accepted mail but couldn't be
 * proven unique (catch-all domains, free providers). Those are deliverable but
 * unconfirmed, so they are opt-in rather than default.
 *
 * `?include=unverifiable` widens it further, to addresses about which the probe
 * learned *nothing* — overwhelmingly because the recipient server refused this
 * sending host rather than judging the mailbox. See `isExportableUnverifiable`
 * in `lib/send-tiers.ts` for why that is a host problem and not a lead problem.
 * Tiers compose: `?include=risky,unverifiable`.
 *
 * Every returned row carries `send_tier`, so the level of proof survives into
 * whatever the export is handed to. Nothing here promotes a lead between tiers.
