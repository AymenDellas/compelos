/**
 * Re-checks leads whose email label is not backed by evidence.
 *
 *   curl -X POST .../api/admin/reverify -d '{"limit":200}'                      # stale VALID
 *   curl -X POST .../api/admin/reverify -d '{"target":"unknown","limit":100}'   # never got an answer
 *
 * Two targets, because they fail for opposite reasons:
 *
 * `unproven-valid` (default) — the label claims proof that isn't there: no
 * direct-SMTP result was recorded, or it has expired. These are excluded from
 * every send list until re-checked, so this is what turns them back into
 * usable leads.
 *
 * `unknown` — the probe never got a verdict at all. Worth retrying because the
 * common causes are temporary: a greylister that has since cleared, a server
 * that was slow, a rate limit that has reset. It is *not* worth retrying in a
 * tight loop, because the other common cause is the recipient server refusing
 * this machine's IP outright, and that answer will not change today. The
 * verifier caches a host-level refusal for 30 minutes and skips the rest of that
 * provider's addresses, so a run over a mostly-blocked backlog now finishes in
 * seconds instead of timing out address by address for hours.
 *
 * Batched at 100 because that's the per-call cap in `verifyLeadEmailsAction`;
 * SMTP pacing is handled inside the verifier and must not be worked around here.
