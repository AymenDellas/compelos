/**
 * Strips verification evidence that no verification run produced.
 *
 * A past data-recovery script promoted rows by writing `email_status='VALID'`,
 * `email_verification_method='SMTP_DIRECT'` and a year-long expiry directly —
 * every field the send gate reads — without ever opening an SMTP socket. Those
 * rows then looked identical to genuinely checked ones and went out on a campaign.
 *
 * A real run always records a score, so a null score alongside SMTP_DIRECT is the
 * signature of a backfill. This clears the *method*, *expiry* and *score* on those
 * rows so they fall back into "VALID label, no proof" — already surfaced in the CRM
 * and already excluded from every export — and leaves the address itself untouched
 * so it can simply be re-verified.
 *
 *   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/revoke-unearned-proof
 *
 * Idempotent: re-running finds nothing once the rows have been cleaned.
