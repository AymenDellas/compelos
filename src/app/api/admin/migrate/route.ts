/**
 * Applies the current schema to the live database: adds any missing columns and
 * indexes, and carries retired pipeline stages forward. Everything in
 * `createSchema()` is idempotent, so running this twice is a no-op.
 *
 *   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/migrate
 *
 * The response reports what is actually in the database afterwards, not merely
 * that the DDL ran without throwing. Those are different claims, and the gap
 * between them is silent: a server still running a build from before a schema
 * change executes the *old* `createSchema()`, applies nothing, and reports
 * success entirely truthfully. The failure then surfaces much later, as an
 * inserter blowing up on a column that was supposedly migrated. If this returns
 * `missingColumns`, restart the server so it picks up the new schema and re-run.
