/**
 * Demotes addresses that were marked VALID on a catch-all domain.
 *
 * Companion to `revoke-unearned-proof`, for the other way a row reached the send
 * list without proof. That one catches rows where no verification ran at all
 * (SMTP_DIRECT with a null score — the signature of a backfill). This one catches
 * rows where verification *did* run, recorded a real score, and still concluded
 * VALID on evidence that cannot support it.
 *
 * The cause: `buildFinalResult` carried an exemption promoting catch-all domains
 * to VALID whenever the MX was Google, on the reasoning that a catch-all "accepts
 * email without bouncing". Accepting at RCPT is not a promise to deliver — Google
 * evaluates routing rules, aliases, and suspended or over-quota mailboxes after
 * the transaction closes and returns an async NDR later, none of which a probe can
 * see. It also promoted addresses at domains like bit.ly, which sit on Google's MX
 * and accept every recipient. 106 rows were affected; 104 were on the live send
 * list. The exemption is gone, and `toPersistedVerification` now enforces the
 * invariant on both write paths, so this only repairs rows written before that.
 *
 * Demotion, not deletion: RISKY keeps the lead in the CRM and still exportable via
 * `?include=risky`, and the address is untouched, so a later verification run can
 * promote it properly if the domain turns out not to be catch-all. The expiry is
 * cleared so the row cannot satisfy the send gate even if its status is changed by
 * something else.
 *
 *   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/revoke-catchall-proof
 *
 * Idempotent: re-running finds nothing once the rows have been demoted.
