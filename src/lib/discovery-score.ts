/**
 * Tier-A discovery scoring — a prioritiser, not a gate.
 *
 * ## What this can and cannot know
 *
 * A Serper result is a headline and roughly 160 characters of snippet. None of the
 * three ICP signals is observable in it:
 *
 *   - "actively posting"  lives in the Voyager activity feed
 *   - "sells a paid offer" lives on their website
 *   - "solo operation"     is a weak guess at best from a headline
 *
 * So this score is explicitly *not* the ICP filter — that belongs at the worker,
 * where those signals actually exist. What it does is kill obvious junk cheaply
 * and rank the INBOX, so the worker's scarce daily budget (400 profiles/day
 * against a five-figure backlog) is spent on the best candidates first. That
 * ranking is re-tunable at any time and applies retroactively to every row that
 * has a score, which a hard filter at discovery time would not.
 *
 * ## Scoring shape
 *
 * Surviving the hard rejects is itself weak evidence — the URL is a real profile,
 * the headline parsed, it matched the niche, it carries no blocklisted term and
 * isn't employer-shaped — so it earns a small base. Everything else is additive.
 *
 * The practical ceiling is ~83, not 100. That is deliberate: the weights were
 * chosen for what each signal is worth relative to the others, and inflating them
 * to reach a round number would only make the scale look more precise than it is.
 * Only the ordering matters, and the Phase 5 calibration query buckets by decile.
 *
 * Pure and side-effect free, so it can be exercised against saved SERP fixtures.
